# Data & analysis tools

Beyond formulas, abax ships a set of point-and-click tools for reshaping,
cleaning, summarising, querying, and plotting a table. They all operate on a
**selected range** in the grid (first row usually read as column names) and write
their results **back into the sheet** (or into a brand-new sheet), so output is
just more cells you can keep working with.

This page covers the everyday **analysis, reshaping, and reporting** side of
abax: importing, pivots/group-by, cleaning, column profiling, SQL over sheets,
goal seek, workbook compare, HTML export, charts, and the pandas hand-off. The
deeper numeric/statistics/ML/signal stack — hypothesis tests, regression, the ML
models, linear algebra, DSP, and ODE solvers — lives in its companion page,
[data science](data-science.md).

Most of these live under **Data → Analyze** in the Qt GUI; the scientific tools
live under **Tools → Scientific**; the HTML export is under **File**; workbook
compare is under **Data**. Almost everything is also reachable from the command
palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`, or `:` on the grid) and, for scripting, from the
[embedded Python console](#the-console-namespace). Engines that can use optional
packages **degrade gracefully** — they fall back to abax's own pure-Python
implementations or tell you exactly which package to install.

Every path above is also on the palette. Two tools write to a **new sheet**
rather than into the current selection: *Compare workbook* (a `Diff` sheet) and
*Profile columns* (a `Profile` sheet).

## Importing data

abax opens or imports almost any tabular format — CSV/TSV, Excel `.xlsx`,
LibreOffice `.ods`, Parquet/Feather, SQLite, JSON / JSON Lines, R `data.frame`,
Jupyter notebooks, Markdown tables, and the native `.abax` workbook. Large CSVs
stream in with type inference and an optional row cap. From the shell,
`abax data.csv` opens it straight in the GUI; `abax convert in.csv out.parquet`
converts headlessly. See [file formats](file-formats.md) and the
[CLI](cli.md) for the full matrix of readers/writers and options.

Once a range is on the grid, the tools below take over. Most read the **first
row as column names** and the rest as data; blank cells are treated as missing.

## Statistics / analysis

The headline analysis tool (**Data → Analyze → Statistics / analysis…**). Select
a numeric range (a non-numeric first row is read as column names), pick an
analysis, choose where to write the output, and run. The dialog shows a
**summary** — statistic, p-value, an effect size, and a one-line plain-English
interpretation — and writes a result **table** back into the grid. Backed by
[`abax/engine/analysis.py`](../abax/engine/analysis.py).

The registry (`analysis.ANALYSES`) drives the menu: descriptive statistics,
two-column t-test, one-way ANOVA, correlation matrix, OLS linear regression, a
Shapiro–Wilk normality check, and Kaplan–Meier survival. Descriptive statistics
and OLS regression always run (stdlib / graceful fallbacks); the others report a
clear "… requires *pkg*" message when their optional dependency is absent.

Because these overlap the statistical stack, the **full test-by-test table,
effect sizes, engines, and worked examples live in the
[data science](data-science.md#the-statistics-analysis-tool) page.** Use this
page for the reshaping/cleaning/reporting tools around it.

## Pivot / group-by

Reshape and summarise a table (**Data → Analyze → Pivot / group-by…**), powered
by [`abax/core/pivot.py`](../abax/core/pivot.py). Select a range (first row =
column names) and choose a mode:

- **Group by** (`pivot.group_by`) — group rows by one or more columns and
  aggregate a value column. The header becomes `[*group_cols, "agg(value_col)"]`.
- **Pivot table** (`pivot.pivot_table`) — an index column down the left,
  distinct values of a second column across the top, each cell the aggregate of
  a value column (blank where a combination has no data).
- **Cross-tab** (`pivot.crosstab`) — a frequency cross-tabulation (counts of
  co-occurrences); the same shape as a pivot table with `count`.

Aggregations (`pivot.AGGREGATIONS`) are `sum`, `mean`, `count`, `min`, `max`,
`median`, `std` (**sample**, n−1), `nunique` (distinct count), and `first`.
Numeric aggregations *skip* blank/non-numeric cells rather than erroring, so a
group with no numeric values aggregates to blank; `count`/`nunique`/`first`
operate on the raw non-blank cells. Keys are sorted **naturally** — numerically
when every key parses as a number, else lexicographically — and floats render
compactly (`5.0` → `5`). Columns are addressed by **name**; an unknown column or
aggregation raises `PivotError`. Rows shorter than the header are treated as
blank-padded (ragged-tolerant). The result block is written back into the sheet.

Example — sales by region, then a region × quarter pivot:

```
Region  Quarter  Amount
West    Q1       120
West    Q2       80
East    Q1       200
```

*Group by* `Region`, value `Amount`, agg `sum` → `West 200`, `East 200`.
*Pivot table* index `Region`, columns `Quarter`, value `Amount`, agg `sum` →
a `Region | Q1 | Q2` grid.

## Recode / clean column

Column-at-a-time cleaning (**Data → Analyze → Recode / clean column…**), powered
by [`abax/core/recode.py`](../abax/core/recode.py). Each operation transforms
every column in the selected range (raw text in, recoded text out) and writes the
result back in place. A single *Options* field is interpreted per operation, with
a live hint. The operations come from `recode.OPERATIONS`:

| Operation | Options | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Re-type column (`retype`) | `int \| float \| bool \| date \| text` | coerce + re-render canonically (`1.0`→`1`, dates→ISO) |
| Fill missing (`fill_missing`) | `value:… \| zero \| mean \| median \| ffill \| bfill` | fill blank cells only |
| Strip whitespace (`strip_whitespace`) | — | trim leading/trailing whitespace |
| Change case (`to_case`) | `upper \| lower \| title` | recase each cell |
| Standardize dates (`standardize_dates`) | output format (default `%Y-%m-%d`) | parse common date forms, re-emit |
| Map / replace values (`map_values`) | `old=new, old2=new2` | exact-match lookup; unmapped → default (or unchanged) |
| Normalize (`normalize`) | `minmax \| zscore` | numeric rescale to [0,1] or z-score (sample std) |
| Clip / clamp (`clip`) | `low,high` (blank side = unbounded) | clamp numeric cells |

Blanks are preserved by every operation except *Fill missing* (whose whole job is
to fill them). Numeric operations (`normalize`, mean/median fill) **raise** on
non-numeric data so text is never silently mangled — *Clip* is the exception: it
passes blanks and non-numeric cells through unchanged, so it is safe on a mixed
column. `standardize_dates` accepts a dozen common forms (ISO, US `m/d/y`,
`02-Jan-2020`, `January 02, 2020`, …); an unrecognised cell is left as-is.

## Profile columns

**Data → Analyze → Profile columns** writes a per-column *describe* of the active
sheet to a fresh **`Profile`** sheet, powered by
[`abax/core/profile.py`](../abax/core/profile.py). For every used column it
infers a dtype (`bool` → `int` → `float`, else `text`, or `empty`) and reports
`count` (non-missing), `missing`, and `unique`. Numeric columns add
`min / max / mean / median / std` (population std) plus quartiles; text columns
add `max_len` and the five most-common values. `None` and `""` are missing; a
column is numeric only when *every* non-missing value parses. Great as a
first-look sanity check before analysis. (Programmatically: `describe()` in the
console returns the same list of stat dicts.)

## SQL query

**Data → Analyze → SQL query…** runs SQL over the workbook's sheets, powered by
[`abax/core/sqlsheets.py`](../abax/core/sqlsheets.py) and the stdlib `sqlite3`.
Each sheet is loaded into an in-memory SQLite table named after the sheet (the
first used row supplies column names). Column affinity is inferred per column
(`INTEGER` / `REAL` / `TEXT`), so numeric columns **aggregate as numbers**, not
concatenated text. Sheet and column names are sanitised to valid SQL identifiers
(non-alphanumerics → `_`, leading digits prefixed) and de-duplicated. The result
`(columns, rows)` is written back to the grid.

```sql
SELECT Region, SUM(Amount) AS total
FROM Sales
GROUP BY Region
ORDER BY total DESC;
```

Any SQLite error — including a reference to an unknown table — surfaces as a
clear `SqlError` message rather than a crash. In the console, `sql("…")` returns
`(columns, rows)` directly.

## Goal seek

**Data → Analyze → Goal seek…** answers "what input makes this cell hit this
target?", powered by [`abax/core/goalseek.py`](../abax/core/goalseek.py). You
pick a cell to vary and a target value for a formula cell; the solver finds the
input. It tries the **secant** method first (fast, no bracket needed) and falls
back to **bisection** when a sign-changing bracket exists or an expanding search
finds one — so it is robust on awkward or poorly-seeded problems. Convergence is
to `tol` (default `1e-9`) within `max_iter` (default 100); failure to converge, a
non-finite result, or an error in the evaluated formula raises `GoalSeekError`.
In the console, `goalseek.goal_seek(f, target, x0)` solves an arbitrary
`f(x) → float`.

## Compare workbook

**Data → Compare workbook…** diffs the current workbook against another file,
powered by [`abax/core/wbdiff.py`](../abax/core/wbdiff.py). It compares the
**raw text you typed** (not computed values) cell-by-cell over the union of used
bounds, classifying each change as `added` (empty→non-empty), `removed`
(non-empty→empty), or `changed`. Results land in a new **`Diff`** sheet: a
one-line summary (`"3 changed, 1 added, 0 removed across 2 sheet(s)…"`) plus a
table of `sheet, row, col, kind, this, other`. Sheets present in only one
workbook are listed by name. In the console, `wbdiff.diff_workbooks(a, b)` and
`wbdiff.summary(diff)` expose the same engine.

## Export as HTML report

**File → Export as HTML report…** writes a standalone `<!DOCTYPE html>` document
— one bordered `<table>` per sheet, with column-letter headers, row numbers, and
each cell's *displayed* value (all escaped) — powered by
[`abax/core/io/html_report.py`](../abax/core/io/html_report.py). Pure stdlib
(`html` only), no external template engine. Large sheets are bounded (default
1000 rows × 100 columns) with a note recording what was omitted. In the console,
`html_report.workbook_to_html(wb)` and `html_report.sheet_to_html(sheet)` return
the HTML string.

## Graph / chart

abax has **two** complementary charting paths, both **without matplotlib**:

**1. The interactive grapher** (**Data → Analyze → Graph / chart…**, also under
Insert) — a live plot painted with QPainter
([`gui/dialogs/graph_dialog.py`](../abax/gui/dialogs/graph_dialog.py), backed by
[`core/graphing.py`](../abax/core/graphing.py)). It can:

- **Plot** a math expression of `x` over a range. The evaluator is sandboxed
  (empty `__builtins__`, only safe math names in scope, `^`→`**`), so a stray
  name errors instead of executing.
- **Plot selection** — the selected column as a series.
- **Histogram** of a column; **Scatter** of two columns (a third colours the
  points); **Regression** scatter with the least-squares fit line.
- **Spectrum (FFT)** and **Spectrogram** of the selected column, and **PCA
  scatter**, **k-means cluster scatter**, and an **ROC curve** — these hand off
  to the science stack (see [data science](data-science.md)).

In the curses TUI, `:plot <expr> [xmin xmax]` renders a **braille** plot
(`graphing.braille_plot`) of an expression or the selected column right in the
terminal.

**2. Exportable SVG charts** — [`core/science/chartsvg.py`](../abax/core/science/chartsvg.py)
is a pure-stdlib generator of complete, self-contained `<svg>…</svg>` strings
(bordered plot area, axes with numeric tick labels, optional title and legend).
Reach it from the [console](#the-console-namespace) as `chartsvg`:

- `chartsvg.line_svg(series, title=…)` — overlaid named line series
  (`[(name, [(x, y), …]), …]`), each in a distinct palette colour with a legend.
- `chartsvg.bar_svg(categories, values, title=…)` — vertical bars.
- `chartsvg.scatter_svg(points, title=…)` — points as circles.
- `chartsvg.histogram_svg(values, bins=10, title=…)` — equal-width bins.

Because the output is a plain SVG string you can drop it into an HTML report,
save it to a file, or embed it anywhere — no rendering backend required.

## Open selection in pandas

A DataFrame viewer (**Data → Analyze → Open selection in pandas…**,
[`gui/dialogs/dataframe_dialog.py`](../abax/gui/dialogs/dataframe_dialog.py))
that loads the selected range as a **typed** pandas DataFrame — each column is
coerced to its inferred type (int / float / bool / date / text) via
`abax.core.typeinfer`. It displays the shape, dtypes, `describe()`, and a head
preview, and can write `describe()` back into the sheet. Requires `pandas`
(auto-installs on first GUI run under the default full-fat install); reports
cleanly if it isn't ready yet. Use this when you want a quick, read-only
pandas-eye view of a block without leaving the app — and the
[console](#the-console-namespace) when you want the full library.

## The console namespace

The embedded Python console (and the sandboxed console worker) is wired to the
live workbook via [`abax/core/console_ns.py`](../abax/core/console_ns.py). Every
engine on this page is exposed by name, so anything a dialog does you can script:

| Name(s) | What it gives you |
| --- | --- |
| `sql("…")` | run SQL over the sheets → `(columns, rows)` |
| `describe()` | per-column profile of the active sheet |
| `profile` | the profiling module (`profile_column`, `profile_sheet`) |
| `wbdiff` | workbook/sheet diff (`diff_workbooks`, `summary`) |
| `goalseek` | `goal_seek(f, target, x0)` |
| `html_report` | `sheet_to_html`, `workbook_to_html` |
| `chartsvg` | `line_svg` / `bar_svg` / `scatter_svg` / `histogram_svg` |
| `urlfetch` | fetch remote data |
| `cell(ref)` / `put(ref, v)` | read/write a single cell |
| `read_matrix("A1:C9")` / `write_matrix("E1", mat)` | range ↔ list-of-lists of floats |
| `sheet_to_df("A1:C9")` / `df_to_sheet(df, "E1")` | range ↔ pandas DataFrame |
| `np` / `pd` / `scipy` / `sm` / `sklearn` / `pingouin` | the optional packages, or `None` if absent |

The science engines (`stats`, `ml`, `cluster`, `trees`, `bayes`, `metrics`,
`gmm`, `matrix`, `eigen`, `numeric`, `units`, `fft`, `signal`, `spectral`,
`filters`, `ode`, `interp`, …) are also all in scope — see
[data science](data-science.md). *(The console runs untrusted code; only run
scripts you trust — see [macros & scripting](macros-and-scripting.md).)*

## Optional dependencies

The analysis engines never hard-require a third-party package; they import them
lazily and degrade. Check what's installed with:

```bash
python -m abax --deps
```

| Package | Used for | Fallback when absent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `scipy` | t-test, ANOVA, correlation, Shapiro–Wilk (the stats tool) | abax core stats engines |
| `statsmodels` | richest OLS output | numpy lstsq, then pure-Python OLS |
| `pingouin` | tidy t-test with effect size | `scipy.stats` |
| `lifelines` | Kaplan–Meier survival | survival analysis unavailable |
| `pandas` | DataFrame viewer / hand-off, Parquet | (those features need pandas) |
| `numpy` | faster OLS fallback, accelerated big reductions | pure-Python paths |

The **reshaping, cleaning, profiling, SQL, goal-seek, compare, HTML-report, and
SVG-chart** engines all run with **zero** optional packages installed — they are
stdlib-only by design. This is the same "pure-stdlib core with graceful
optional-dependency upgrades" philosophy that runs through the whole
[data-science stack](data-science.md).
