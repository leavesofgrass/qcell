# File formats

qcell is JSON-first but reads and writes many tabular formats. Every open and
save is dispatched purely by **file extension** in
[`qcell/engine/document.py`](../qcell/engine/document.py) — the single façade the
GUI, TUI, and CLI all call. This page lists every supported format, what import
and export actually do, and which formats need an optional dependency.

## At a glance

| Format | Extensions | Read | Write | Optional dep | Fallback when absent |
| --- | --- | :---: | :---: | --- | --- |
| Native workbook | `.json` `.qcell` | yes | yes | — (stdlib `json`) | always available |
| CSV | `.csv` | yes | yes | — | always available |
| TSV / tab | `.tsv` `.tab` | yes | yes | — | always available |
| Excel | `.xlsx` `.xlsm` | yes | yes | `openpyxl` | error with install hint |
| OpenDocument | `.ods` | yes | yes | — (stdlib `zipfile`+`xml`) | always available |
| Parquet | `.parquet` `.pq` | yes | yes | `pandas` + `pyarrow`/`fastparquet` | error with install hint |
| Feather | `.feather` `.ft` | yes | yes | `pandas` + `pyarrow`/`fastparquet` | error with install hint |
| XML Spreadsheet | `.xml` | yes | yes | — | always available |
| Markdown (GFM) | `.md` `.markdown` | yes | yes | — | always available |
| Jupyter notebook | `.ipynb` | yes | yes | — (no `nbformat` needed) | always available |
| R data.frame | `.r` `.rdata` | yes | yes | — | always available |
| JSON Lines | `.jsonl` `.ndjson` | yes | yes | — | always available |

Only **Excel** and **Parquet/Feather** require third-party packages. Everything
else is pure standard library and works in a zero-optional-dependency install.
Run `python -m qcell --deps` to see what is installed on your machine.

## A shared data model

Whatever the source format, importing produces the same in-memory model: a
`Workbook` of one or more `Sheet`s, where each cell holds **raw text**. A field
that begins with `=` becomes a formula and is re-evaluated by qcell's own engine
(see the [formula reference](formula-reference.md)); everything else is a literal
value. Single-sheet formats (CSV, Markdown, JSON Lines, fixed-width, Parquet)
load into a one-sheet workbook; multi-sheet formats (native JSON, Excel, XML,
notebooks, R, SQLite) preserve every sheet/table.

On export, most formats write **computed values** by default (what you see in the
grid), while a few write **raw text** so formulas survive a round-trip — see each
format below.

## Native workbook (`.json` / `.qcell`)

qcell's own format is a self-describing JSON **envelope** produced by
`Workbook.to_envelope` ([`qcell/core/workbook.py`](../qcell/core/workbook.py)):

```json
{
  "app": "qcell",
  "schema_version": 3,
  "written_at": "2026-06-29T12:00:00+00:00",
  "data": {
    "active": 0,
    "names": { },
    "sheets": [
      {
        "name": "Sheet1",
        "cells": { "A1": "Item", "B1": "Price", "B2": "=A2*1.1" },
        "cond_rules": [],
        "formats": {},
        "styles": {},
        "validations": []
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

This is fully lossless: cell text and formulas, multiple sheets, the active
sheet, named ranges, conditional-formatting rules, per-cell number formats and
styles, and data validations are all preserved. `schema_version` lets older
files migrate forward on load.

### `.json` auto-detects native vs foreign

A `.json` (or `.qcell`) file is opened through
[`qcell/core/io/exchange_io.py`](../qcell/core/io/exchange_io.py), which inspects the
payload shape and does the right thing:

- **qcell workbook envelope** (`data.sheets` present) → loaded losslessly.
- **qrpn calculator save** (`{stack, registers}`) → a `stack` sheet plus a
  `registers` key/value sheet.
- **list of objects** (records) → one row per object; keys become the header row.
- **list of lists** → rows verbatim.
- **dict of equal-length lists** → columns (keys become headers).
- **dict of scalars** → a two-column `key` / `value` sheet.

This means you can drop almost any JSON another tool wrote into qcell and get a
sensible table back.

### The generic interchange envelope

The spec's "JSON everywhere" principle (§3e) is the shape

```json
{ "app": "<producer>", "schema_version": <int>, "written_at": "<iso8601>", "data": <payload> }
```

Any tool can write this; qcell reads it by examining `data`. `app` is used as a
hint (for example an `app` containing `qrpn` is treated as a calculator save).
qcell's own `to_exchange` simply returns the workbook envelope above — so qcell's
native files *are* valid interchange envelopes.

## CSV / TSV / tab (`.csv`, `.tsv`, `.tab`)

Implemented in [`qcell/core/io/csv_io.py`](../qcell/core/io/csv_io.py) on the stdlib
`csv` module. Import places each field as raw cell text (a field starting with
`=` becomes a formula); empty fields are skipped. `.tsv`/`.tab` use a tab
delimiter. Export writes **computed values** by default (`values=True`); the API
can also write raw text to preserve formulas (`values=False`). UTF-8 throughout.

```bash
python -m qcell convert data.csv data.tsv
python -m qcell view data.csv
```

### Streaming large CSVs

[`qcell/core/io/csv_stream.py`](../qcell/core/io/csv_stream.py) imports big CSVs
without loading the whole file into memory. It provides:

- `sniff_csv(path)` — a fast **preview**: delimiter and header detection, a
  sample of rows, an approximate total row count (exact under 5 MB, estimated
  above), and a per-column inferred type (int / float / bool / date / text via
  `qcell.core.typeinfer`).
- `iter_chunks(path, n)` — yields fixed-size chunks of rows; the file is never
  fully materialised.
- `load_csv_streaming(path, max_rows=..., coerce_types=True)` — builds a sheet
  from a bounded number of rows, optionally coercing each column to its inferred
  type.

## Excel (`.xlsx`, `.xlsm`) — needs `openpyxl`

[`qcell/engine/excel_io.py`](../qcell/engine/excel_io.py) uses `openpyxl`. Every
worksheet becomes a sheet. The workbook is loaded with `data_only=False`, so
Excel formulas are kept **as text** and re-evaluated by qcell rather than read as
cached values. On export the default writes **raw cell text** (so formulas
survive the round-trip into Excel); the API can write computed values instead.
Sheet titles are capped at Excel's 31-character limit.

If `openpyxl` is not installed, both load and save raise a `RuntimeError` with a
clear hint:

```
pip install openpyxl
# or:  pip install qcell[excel]
```

## OpenDocument spreadsheet (`.ods`)

[`qcell/engine/ods_io.py`](../qcell/engine/ods_io.py) is **pure stdlib** — it
reads and writes the ODF `content.xml` directly with `zipfile` and
`xml.etree.ElementTree`, so it needs no `odfpy`/`ezodf`. Import reads the **first**
sheet, honouring `number-columns-repeated` / `number-rows-repeated` (repeats are
expanded, but trailing empty repeats are dropped so they never inflate the
sheet). Export writes the active sheet as a valid `.ods` ZIP (the `mimetype`
member is stored first, uncompressed, per the ODF packaging spec). Cells that
parse as numbers are written as `float`; everything else as `string`.

## Parquet / Feather (`.parquet`, `.pq`, `.feather`, `.ft`) — needs `pandas` + engine

[`qcell/engine/parquet_io.py`](../qcell/engine/parquet_io.py) uses `pandas` plus
a columnar engine (`pyarrow` or `fastparquet`). The DataFrame's column names
become the header row; every value is stringified (nulls → empty cells). Export
treats row 0 as the header and writes the **active sheet** only, using displayed
values. The extension picks the writer: `.feather`/`.ft` → Feather, otherwise
Parquet.

Missing dependency raises `ParquetError`:

```
pip install pandas pyarrow
# or:  pip install qcell[fast-io]
```

## XML Spreadsheet / SpreadsheetML (`.xml`)

[`qcell/core/io/xml_io.py`](../qcell/core/io/xml_io.py) reads and writes the Excel 2003
"XML Spreadsheet" dialect (`<Worksheet>/<Table>/<Row>/<Cell>/<Data>`), which both
Excel and gnumeric understand — pure stdlib. Notable details:

- Formulas are stored in **R1C1** in the `ss:Formula` attribute and converted
  to/from A1 via [`qcell/core/r1c1.py`](../qcell/core/r1c1.py).
- Sparse rows and cells use `ss:Index` (so gaps don't bloat the file).
- `ss:Type` is written/read as `Number`, `String`, or `Boolean`.
- Cell errors are emitted as strings.

## Markdown GFM tables (`.md`, `.markdown`)

[`qcell/core/io/markdown_io.py`](../qcell/core/io/markdown_io.py) treats GitHub-Flavored
Markdown tables as a first-class format. Export produces a padded,
alignment-aware table (per-column `l`/`c`/`r`), using the first row as the header
(or column letters if you turn headers off), and renders **computed values**.
Pipes, backslashes, and newlines in cell text are escaped (`\|`, `\\`, `<br>`).
Import parses the **first** GFM table found in the file and drops the alignment
separator row.

```markdown
| Item   | Price |
| :---   | ----: |
| Apple  | 1.10  |
| Pear   | 0.95  |
```

The GUI command palette also offers **Copy selection as Markdown**.

## Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb`)

[`qcell/core/io/notebook_io.py`](../qcell/core/io/notebook_io.py) reads and writes
nbformat 4 with **no `nbformat` dependency**. Export emits, per sheet, a Markdown
cell (a `## heading` plus a GFM table) and a code cell that rebuilds the sheet as
a pandas `DataFrame`. Import scans Markdown cells for GFM tables; each table
becomes a sheet named after the nearest heading.

## R data.frame (`.r`, `.rdata`)

[`qcell/core/io/r_io.py`](../qcell/core/io/r_io.py) exports each sheet as a
`name <- data.frame(col = c(...), ...)` block (first row supplies the column
names, `stringsAsFactors = FALSE`). Import is a **best-effort** parser for that
same shape and for bare `name <- c(...)` vectors. Strings are quoted/escaped,
`NA` round-trips to a blank cell, and `TRUE`/`FALSE`/`T`/`F` are recognised.

## JSON Lines (`.jsonl`, `.ndjson`)

[`qcell/core/io/flatfile_io.py`](../qcell/core/io/flatfile_io.py) — one JSON object per
line. On import, row 0 is the ordered union of all object keys (first-seen
order); each later row holds that object's values as strings, with a missing key
left blank. On export, row 0 supplies the field names and each later row becomes
one JSON object `{field: value}` from the raw cell text (empty trailing fields
skipped).

## Fixed-width text (`.fixed`)

Also in [`qcell/core/io/flatfile_io.py`](../qcell/core/io/flatfile_io.py). Import either
slices each line by explicit character widths or, by default, splits on runs of
two-or-more spaces (the layout of `column -t` output). Export renders each column
left-aligned and padded to its widest value plus a gap.

## SQLite (`.db`, `.sqlite`, `.sqlite3`)

[`qcell/core/io/sqlite_io.py`](../qcell/core/io/sqlite_io.py) uses the stdlib `sqlite3`
module. Opening a database loads **every user table** (excluding `sqlite_*`
internals) into its own sheet; row 0 is the column names and rows 1.. are the
data, all stored as text. Saving writes the active sheet to one table: row 0
supplies column names (sanitized to safe identifiers, blanks → `col_1`…),
columns are created as `TEXT`, and rows are inserted with **parameterized**
queries (empty cells become `NULL`). Identifiers are always double-quoted with
embedded quotes escaped; values are never string-formatted into SQL.

The module API also supports loading a single table or an arbitrary
`SELECT … ` query, and choosing `replace` / `append` / `fail` when a table
already exists.

## Quick reference: converting between formats

The headless CLI converts by extension — no GUI required:

```bash
python -m qcell convert sales.xlsx sales.csv      # Excel  → CSV
python -m qcell convert data.csv data.parquet     # CSV    → Parquet
python -m qcell convert book.qcell book.ods        # native → OpenDocument
python -m qcell convert table.db table.md          # SQLite → Markdown
```

See the [command-line interface](cli.md) for the full set of subcommands.
