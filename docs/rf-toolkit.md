# RF / ham-radio toolkit

abax ships a set of **radio-frequency engineering functions** — power/level
conversions, transmission-line and matching math, link-budget and propagation
formulas, antenna helpers, and the **Maidenhead grid locator** — so you can build a
link budget, antenna, or matching spreadsheet natively. They are backed by
[`abax/core/science/rf.py`](../abax/core/science/rf.py) (pure standard library;
no third-party dependency).

## Units

The formula functions use **SI base units** so they stay unambiguous and
unit-neutral:

| Quantity | Unit |
| --- | --- |
| frequency | hertz (Hz) — e.g. `14.2e6` for 14.2 MHz |
| length / distance / wavelength | metre (m) |
| power | watt (W); levels in dBm / dBW / dB |
| inductance · capacitance | henry (H) · farad (F) |
| impedance | ohm (Ω) |

Put MHz/feet in your own cells and scale, or use `CONVERT` (see
[file formats / functions](formula-reference.md)) — e.g. `=CONVERT(A1,"ft","m")`.
The **RF toolkit dialog** and **Smith chart** (*Radio* menu) accept MHz / feet
directly and show results in both metric and imperial.

## GUI tools (the *Radio* menu)

All of the RF/ham tools live under the **Tools → Radio** submenu (general
math tools stay under *Tools → Scientific*):

- **RF toolkit** — a mode-switching dialog for **link budget**, **coax line**,
  **antenna dimensions**, and **L-network matching**, showing results in both
  metric and imperial where it helps.
- **Smith chart** — plots a load impedance and its reflection coefficient, reports
  VSWR / return loss, and computes the two L-network matching solutions.
- **Antenna pattern** — a polar plot of the analytic dipole / array patterns with
  directivity (dBi) and half-power beamwidth. It re-plots live as you change N /
  spacing / phase, and **exports the pattern as SVG** or a **NEC `.nec`** deck.
- **RF reference** — a filterable view of the US amateur band plan (with width and
  mid-band wavelength) and the 50 EIA CTCSS tones; double-click (or *Send to cell*)
  writes a value into the grid, and *Bands → new sheet* drops the band plan in.
- **I/Q → SVG** — reads a two-column (I, Q) selection and exports the constellation
  as an SVG, reporting power in dBFS.
- **Solve NEC deck (PyNEC)** — see below.

## Antenna impedance

Closed-form dipole input impedance by the induced-EMF method (validated against the
textbook 73.1 + j42.5 Ω half-wave result):

| Function | Returns |
| --- | --- |
| `DIPOLER(length_wl, [radius_wl])` | input resistance (Ω) |
| `DIPOLEX(length_wl, [radius_wl])` | input reactance (Ω) |
| `RADRESIST(length_wl)` | radiation resistance (Ω) |
| `RESONANTLEN([radius_wl])` | resonant length (wavelengths), just under 0.5 λ |

## Antenna modeling — Method of Moments & NEC

For real wire-antenna analysis, abax has a thin-wire **Method of Moments** solver
(pure stdlib), available in the Python console:

```python
from abax.core.science import mom, wire_mom, nec

mom.dipole_input_impedance(0.5, 1e-3)          # a straight dipole
wire_mom.yagi(0.47, [(0.5, -0.25), (0.45, 0.15)], spacing_wl=0.2)  # a Yagi
```

- `mom` — a straight center-fed dipole. A single basis reproduces the induced-EMF
  impedance to 5 significant figures; the converged multi-segment result matches NEC.
- `wire_mom` — arbitrary 3-D wire structures (bent wires, V antennas, parasitic
  **Yagi** arrays), with a far-field pattern and front-to-back ratio.
- `nec` — read and write NEC2 `.nec` decks (`parse_nec` / `to_nec` / `solve`), so
  abax exchanges models with 4nec2 / EZNEC / xnec2c. The Antenna pattern viewer's
  *Export NEC* button writes a deck for the current geometry.

### Optional PyNEC solver (reference-grade)

For reference-grade accuracy abax can hand a deck to **PyNEC** (the SWIG binding
to the classic NEC-2 engine) when it is installed — *Radio → Solve NEC deck
(PyNEC)*, backed by `engine/necpy.py`. It is a fully **optional** dependency
with a **graceful fallback**: if PyNEC is not importable, abax silently uses its
own built-in Method-of-Moments solver instead, so nothing breaks. `abax --deps`
reports whether PyNEC is present.

**Platform note (why it may be absent).** PyNEC is a compiled C++/SWIG
extension and does **not** publish wheels for every platform — notably there are
no Windows wheels. It is included in the `nec` extra and in `all` (so the
background auto-installer *attempts* it on a default install), but on a machine
without a matching wheel that best-effort build can fail quietly; abax then just
keeps using the built-in solver. This is deliberate — PyNEC is a
nice-to-have accelerator, not a requirement.

To install it yourself:

```bash
pip install abax[nec]      # or: pip install PyNEC
```

On Windows (or any platform lacking a wheel) the build needs a C/C++ toolchain
and SWIG on `PATH` — e.g. MSVC Build Tools plus `swig`. If that is more than you
want, do nothing: the built-in `mom` / `wire_mom` / `nec` path above is the
supported default and matches NEC on the validation cases.

## Signal / DSP

RF signal work is served by the no-numpy DSP stack (*Tools → Signal / data tool*):
FFT / STFT / spectrogram, **Welch PSD** (real one-sided and complex **I/Q**
two-sided — a two-column selection is read as quadrature), interpolation,
Butterworth/FIR filters, and ODE solvers. See
[data-science.md](data-science.md) and the console modules `fft`, `spectral`,
`filters`, `signal`.
