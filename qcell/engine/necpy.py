"""PyNEC adapter — the reference-grade optional solver for NEC antenna decks.

The middle-layer (engine) counterpart to the built-in Method-of-Moments solver in
:mod:`qcell.core.science.nec` / :mod:`qcell.core.science.wire_mom`. Those are pure
stdlib and always available; this module instead drives **PyNEC** (the Python
binding for the classic NEC2 kernel), which is the community reference for
wire-antenna accuracy but is a heavyweight, optional native dependency.

PyNEC is almost never installed, so the import is guarded: importing this module
never fails, and :func:`available` reports whether the real solve path can run.
The parse / serialise / metadata plumbing (via :mod:`qcell.core.science.nec`) is
pure stdlib and always exercised; only the actual field solve needs PyNEC.

Units: qcell keeps geometry in **wavelengths**; PyNEC (like NEC itself) works in
**metres** at a real frequency. We convert with ``lam = c / f`` before feeding the
kernel. NEC excites a *segment*; we pass the feed segment straight through.
