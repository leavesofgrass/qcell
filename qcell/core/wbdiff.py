"""Cell-by-cell diff of two sheets or workbooks.

Pure stdlib, part of :mod:`qcell.core`. Operates entirely through the public
``Sheet`` / ``Workbook`` API (raw cell text, used bounds, sheet list), so a diff
compares what the user actually typed rather than computed values.

A cell is *empty* when :meth:`Sheet.get_raw` returns ``""``. Each cell-level
change is classified as:

* ``"added"``   — empty in *a*, non-empty in *b*
* ``"removed"`` — non-empty in *a*, empty in *b*
* ``"changed"`` — non-empty in both and the raw text differs
