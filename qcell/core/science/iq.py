"""I/Q (complex baseband) analysis for qcell's DSP/RF toolkit.

A small, dependency-free set of routines for inspecting quadrature-sampled
(complex baseband) signals, where each sample is a Python ``complex`` carrying
the in-phase component in ``.real`` and the quadrature component in ``.imag``
(``I + jQ``). Everything runs on the stdlib :mod:`math` module only -- no numpy,
no third-party code (qcell ``core`` is stdlib-only).

Contents:

* :func:`constellation_points` -- unpack samples into ``(I, Q)`` pairs, the
  natural form for scatter-plotting a constellation diagram.
* :func:`eye_diagram` -- slice the real part into overlapping two-symbol
  traces for an eye diagram.
* :func:`evm` -- error-vector-magnitude percentage against a reference.
* :func:`power_dbfs` -- average signal power in dBFS (magnitude 1.0 = 0 dBFS).

Bad arguments raise :class:`ValueError` rather than returning a bogus result.
